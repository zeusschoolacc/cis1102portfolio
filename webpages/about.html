            <h2>This is my CIS 1102N Final Term Project : Online Portfolio</h2>
            <p>This online portfolio is all about my works and learnings throughout the whole Introduction to Computing course handled by Sir Opone. As a proud student of Sir Opone, I can really say that I have learned a lot from him when it comes to the field of technology. Although this may not be one of those typical, formal portfolios that you see online, I take pride in my portfolio's uniqueness, which was crafted around a distinct theme, "The Jungle." Just as the jungle holds its mysteries and surprises, I went through this course with uncertainty, never quite sure what I would encounter. So basically, this portfolio is my way of showing my journey though the jungle of "CIS 1102N: Introduction to Computing."</p>
